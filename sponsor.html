					In addition to the guidance from our esteemed faculty advisors, we’re dependent on partnerships with generous sponsors to embark on this journey. We aim to build a submarine capable of navigating an underwater course, and reaching the finals of an international competition. This will require significant, but intelligent expenditure. A significant fraction of our expenditure will be utilized in buying parts, such as sensors, hydrophones, GPUs, depth sensors and batteries. In addition to using the software for analysis and CAD available in engineering labs, we anticipate the need for purchasing licenses for key softwares when we are out pool testing or at competition. After building the submarine, we’ll also incur expenses relating to logistics, such as travel, lodging and transportation costs. Furthermore, there will always be things breaking, as we strive to build a submarine to navigate complex challenges through an underwater course. Hence, we must also take into consideration contingencies and miscellaneous costs. </p>

					<p>Building an autonomous underwater vehicle is not for the faint-hearted. A partnership will provide access to driven STEM students working with world-class faculty on exploring cutting-edge technology and applying it to solve a real-life challenge. In addition, there are numerous opportunities for representation of your company’s name and logo on team apparel, the website, posters, and even the submarine. In addition, we plan to host testing at the Urbana community pool, and reach out to interested high-school students and engage them. Before the competition, the team also publishes and submits a research paper, outlining the research and innovation that went into building the submarine. As a sponsor, your company’s name will be included on that paper. We are also open to non-monetary sponsorships, through which donations of parts, software licenses and airfare waivers can be made.</p>
